# PIP-0034A Overview: New PascalCoin Website
## Full PIP: https://github.com/bbedward/PascalCoin/blob/pip-0034b/PIP/PIP-0034A.md

## Overview
The websites of a cryptocurrency often serves a gateway to bring potential new users by introducing them to the project. They also act as a news source and a wiki for existing users to learn more about the cryptocurrency. The content of these websites often seen by the new users as an initial way of judging the potential of given project. Because of these reasons, the websites need to be intriguing, understandable and beautiful while clearly communicating the core values and the products that the cryptocurrency offers.

We are proposing to redesign the [pascalcoin.org][pascal-website] website. This includes a comprehensive new design as well as a complete rewrite of the existing website's frontend.

## Deliverables
1) The design of the website including all the source files, animations, illustrations, and the implementation guide.
2) Application of the suggestions and revision(s) (up to 3 rounds of revisions).
3) Write the code for the frontend implementing all parts of the design - using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other libraries and frameworks as necessary.
4) Integrate the new frontend code into the existing PHP/Laravel codebase.

## Timeline
* Completion of deliverable #1: 12 days.
* Completion of deliverable #2: 2-6 days (varies depending on the number of revision requests).
* Completion of deliverable #3: 30 days.
* Completion of deliverable #4: 14 days.

## Payment Schedule
* $2000: Upon completion of (1).
* $500: Upon completion of (2).
* $4000: Upon completion of (3)
* $2000: Upon the completion of (4)

Total: $8500

(It is extremely rare that more than 3 rounds of revision requests will be required during the design process, but if that's the case, each round of revisions after the 3rd one will cost an additional $250)

## Licensing
The design, artwork, animations, and other assets that are created by us for this proposal will be released under [**CC0**][creative-commons] license, or any license suggested by PascalCoin Foundation.

All code will be merged into the existing [PascalCoin.org GitHub][pascalcoin-github] repository, and will be licensed the same as the existing codebase.
